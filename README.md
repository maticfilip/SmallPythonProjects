1. A simple calculator app in Python. My first interaction with Tkinter and with Python GUI.
Took around 45 minutes to code after watching a tutorial available on YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdqUPsDbLLc&list=PLl316cKxhMxtOWHa88kDqm42uWz1aqGfD&index=4)
2. A sudoku solver. Used as my first interaction with backtracking. Made while following a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_T-brYofN4&t=448s)
3. File ogranizer. A simple file organizer app, organises file based on their type/extensions. Allows to sellect a directory and creates new folders for different types of files. Simple .exe available in the repository.
4. Discord bot. A simple discord bot, will be further modified for real time using. This one has some small interactions with the bot, allows admin to warn users and count warnings, and automatically adds warnings for foul words resulting in a ban.
