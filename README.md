1. A simple calculator app in Python. My first interaction with Tkinter and with Python GUI.
Took around 45 minutes to code after watching a tutorial available on YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdqUPsDbLLc&list=PLl316cKxhMxtOWHa88kDqm42uWz1aqGfD&index=4)
2. A sudoku solver. Used as my first interaction with backtracking. Made while following a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_T-brYofN4&t=448s)
3. File ogranizer. A simple file organizer app, organises file based on their type/extensions. Allows to sellect a directory and creates new folders for different types of files. Simple .exe available in the repository.
